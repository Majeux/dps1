# DPS assignment 1

This is a reproduction of some experiments in <https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.08496> on the das5 cluster.
The project is subdivided into 3 components:

- **generator:** *A custom data generator which connects to the storm cluster with a TCP socket.* 
- **storm\_bench:** *A custom topology that aggregates some field by key, similar to the workload from the paper.*
- **deployment:** *Scripts to deploy the above tools onto the das5 cluster.*
